Bloody drug war
Official Philippine National Police data show at least 1,523 suspects were killed in anti-drug police operations from July 1 to October 7.

Over 26,000 individuals have been arrested.

The killings have drawn global attention and condemnation from the world's most powerful leaders, such as United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon and U.S. President Barack Obama.

The Duterte administration has repeatedly denied alleged extrajudicial killings, which is being investigated by the Senate.

"We reiterate: The Duterte administration does not condone summary execution or extrajudicial killing of drug suspects," Andanar said. "The Philippine National Police is investigating all cases of extrajudicial killings and will prosecute the perpetrators to the full extent of the law."

Critics have also pointed out that only the poor and small time drug users have fallen targets to the government's war on drugs.

But the President said it's because they are "easy targets" as compared to wealthy suspects who can easily fly out of the country. The poor also outnumber the rich, Duterte explained.

<P>In the run-up to the Philippines' 2016 presidential elections, Rodrigo Duterte promised to suppress crime, drugs and corruption in government within the first three to six months of his tenure, and to fatten the fish in Manila Bay with the bodies of 100,000 criminals.

Watch - Rodrigo Duterte: Guns, Goons and the Presidency
At a party to celebrate his election victory in Davao City, where he had been mayor for more than 20 years, the president-elect urged armed citizens to kill drug dealers. "Do it yourselves if you have guns, you have my support," he told them.

After his inaugural speech Duterte again urged citizens to go ahead and kill drug addicts because "getting their parents to do it would be too painful", and said that he didn't care about human rights or due process.

"We will not stop until the last drug lord, the last financier and the last pusher have surrendered or [been] put behind bars or below the ground," he said in his first state of the nation address.

Duterte's war against drugs is being waged from the streets to the senate, but its casualties are almost exclusively small timers in shanty streets like F Munoz. Here, the victims die wearing flip-flops and often with a sachet of methamphetamines - shabu - about their person.

Extrajudicial killings are not new to the Philippines: It has been reported that Amnesty International estimates 3,240 were carried out under dictator Ferdinand Marcos before the People Power Revolution of 1986. However, the intensity of the deaths under Duterte - who has called Marcos the "best president" and pressed for his burial in the country's Heroes' Cemetery - is unprecedented.

According to a national police report obtained by Al Jazeera, from July 1 to September 5, 2016, some 1,027 suspects were killed during police operations. A further 15,055 suspects were arrested and more than 686,000 "surrendered voluntarily" to police. The death toll constitutes a more than fifteen-fold jump over the 68 police killings recorded between January 1 and June 15, a period of more than five months.

There were at least 1,500 further cases listed as "found dead body under investigation" during the same period, according to PNP records.

Such bodies - which have appeared throughout the slums, above ground at Malabon City Cemetery, and even splayed across EDSA, the congested arterial highway through the city's heart - are mostly attributed to vigilantes, or to drug syndicate infighting.

Sometimes the heads of those killed are found bound in duct tape; often bodies are strewn with cardboard signs with slogans reading "I'm a drug pusher, don't be like me". 

Whether from police operations, the result of syndicates "cleaning house", or perpetrated by "death squads", the killings show no sign of abating. "I will retire with the reputation of Idi Amin," said President Duterte, whose term is scheduled for six years.
